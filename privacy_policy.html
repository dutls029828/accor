                    <b class="M516">Good to know!</b>
                    <p>As you may not know, the hotel you have booked is probably not owned by an Accor SA subsidiary or affiliate. Most of the hotels operating under one of the group's Accor 
                        hotel brands are actually franchised or “managed” agreements between the hotel's owner and Accor SA (or one of its affiliates worldwide). This is why, if you stay at one of 
                        these hotels, your personal data is processed by Accor Sa and the hotel, each of which is responsible for the processing of the data for its own purposes. To summarize briefly:</p>
                    <ul class="disc">
                        <li>As Accor SA is responsible for managing the central reservation system, Accor SA may collect data necessary for accommodation arrangements at hotels operated by one of 
                            the Accor hotel brands, and may transfer this data to the relevant hotels. Accor SA manages the global information of customers staying at hotels operated by one of the 
                            Accor hotel brands. Accor SA, with the help of its subsidiary Pro-Fid SAS, also manages Le Club Accor's fairness program.</li>
                        <li>All hotels process your information to manage their contractual relationship with you (billing, payment, reservation management, etc.), to conduct marketing activities and 
                            to comply with their legal obligations. 
                          </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Accor SA has transferred all of the principles set out in this Policy to all hotels operating under the Accor Hotels brand and their owners. We will do everything within our 
                        capabilities to ensure that all hotels comply with applicable laws and this policy for the protection of personal information.</p>

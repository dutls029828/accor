                        <p>In order to use the welcome service, the customer must comply with the contents of the applicable item without exception. To make check-out of facility customers simple 
                            and fast, Accor provides a welcome service. This is a digital process that allows you to digitally process your check-in and/or check-out prior to your stay, and if this service is 
                            suitable for your reservation, you can use it. The customer will receive a response from the facility within 2 days of requesting the availability of this service. In some cases, 
                            online check-in is only possible where online check-out is available. In this case, the customer can refuse online check-out (also called "fast check-out"). In this case, the check
                            -in request received online will also be canceled and, more broadly, the welcome service will be cancelled. If online check-out is not mandatory, guests may check-in online 
                            and have check-out handled at the facility. When using online checkout, an authorization request (also called "pre-authorization") is issued by the customer's bank. This 
                            procedure provides a valid deposit for an amount expected to incur during the stay and authorization for payment to the facility up to the maximum amount authorized by 
                            the bank to the customer based on the customer's actual usage costs. The facility will only charge the actual amount of the bill from the time the guest leaves the stay, and 
                            the guest does not require physical presence at the facility or additional authorization to make payment. The amount requested for authorization includes the amount of the 
                            reservation (or the remaining amount to be paid if partial prepayment was made at the time of booking) and a fixed amount to cover the guest's consumption or expenses 
                            on site (if not included in the rate, breakfast, restaurant, bar, Accommodation tax, etc.) are included. This fixed amount is determined by the property based on the number of 
                            people booked and the number of nights. Example: 2 nights at 130 euros per night + 40 euros for an extra = 300 euros authorization request. Authorization requests are not 
                            intended for immediate payment, but rather as a reserve for future payments at the customer's bank, which temporarily reduces the credit card's limit to secure future 
                            transfers. However, in some cases, the authorization request may be marked as debit pending on the bank account of the card used. Once the authorization request is 
                            activated and confirmed by the bank, at the end of the stay, the facility will send a payment request for the amount of the invoice to the guest's bank.</p>
                        <ul class="disc">
                            <li>
                                If the charge is less than the amount requested for authorization, the actual amount owed by the customer equals the actual charge on the card. The card limit will be 
                                readjusted (released) by the customer's bank to account for this difference (there may be some delay depending on the bank).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the charge is greater than the amount requested for approval, the facility will use all acceptable amounts. Any remaining charges will be charged to the same card. 
                                Therefore, two withdrawals will be processed to the customer's account. One is the requested authorization amount, and the other is an additional amount. Separately, we 
                                recommend that you go to reception to adjust the amount requested for authorization or to pay directly.                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If a reservation is canceled after the authorization request has been activated, the authorization request cancellation will automatically be sent to the bank of the cardholder 
                                used. In rare cases, this cancellation may be treated as a refund.                            </li>

                                is never an immediate charge.

                    actions may stop the execution of the reservation or, if the analysis results do not guarantee the security of the order, cancel the reservation. Fraudulent use of payment 
                    methods that result in payment errors may result in the customer being registered in Group Accor Hotels' incident file, which may result in Group Accor Hotels blocking 
                    future payments or implementing additional controls. Customers may exercise their rights under the Privacy Policy at any time. All information useful for this purpose is

                            <p>Accor Plus members automatically enjoy Silver membership status at hotels participating in the ALL loyalty program. Your tier is determined by your Accor Plus account 
                                activity over 12 months (365 days). When you renew in the Accor Advantage Plus program, you will receive a membership level that corresponds to your performance 
                                calculated over the previous 12 months (see transition fee below). If you are an Accor Plus member, your membership tier will not drop to the Classic tier. The rules for 
                                obtaining ALL program benefits depend on the ALL membership level at the time of stay (check-in date). ALL program benefits are provided only if the stay is valid and ALL is 
                                eligible for accrual.</p>
                            <p>If you do not renew your membership at the end of its validity period, your membership to the Accor Plus program will be terminated and you will be ineligible for benefits. 
                                However, membership in the ALL program will remain. Review activity performance for the previous year and the current year. The period most favorable to the member is 
                                used to determine the new tier. If the same rank can be maintained in the most favorable period, the same rank will be maintained. Otherwise, you will receive the next lower 
                                rating regardless of your activity performance. Your Tier and Tier Nights will be maintained until the end of the validity period.</p>

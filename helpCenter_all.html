                                Whenever you redeem your Rewards points at a hotel, you will automatically receive an email confirming that you have redeemed them during your stay. When you spend 
                                4,000 points or more, your transaction is protected by a 4-digit code sent to you via SMS and/or email. You must present this code to the receptionist to complete the

                                    You do not have to pay for a room reservation with your Rewards points in order to use your Rewards points to book additional services. You may pay for your room 
                                    reservation using any other payment method accepted by the hotel.

                                    Members must have enough Rewards points to pay in full for the services they intend to book. Unlike when booking a room, there is no minimum threshold of 2,000 
                                    Rewards points. For example, you have 1,250 Rewards points, and it costs 1,250 Rewards points to reserve breakfast. If you try to book two breakfasts, you can only book one 
                                    using your Rewards points, but you must pay for the other breakfast using your bank card or other payment method accepted by the hotel. On the other hand, if you only 
                                    have 700 Rewards points, you cannot use the 700 Rewards points to book a breakfast, and you must pay the rest with your bank card.

                    <p>Any changes to the date, length of stay, type of Apartment or stay location in the booking initially confirmed by ADAGIO shall be considered a partial cancellation of the 
                        booking. If the partial cancellation of a booking corresponds to a change in the length of stay, this is likely to result in a change in the rate, given that ADAGIO's tiered pricing 
                        system is in relation to the length of a stay. If the length of stay is shorter than that initially booked, the rate change will be retroactive up to the day of arrival. Subject to 
                        availability and at ADAGIO's discretion, the length of the stay may also be changed with no obligation to stay in the same Apartment or for the same price.

                <div class="L316">
                    <p>Internal regulations are displayed at each Aparthotel and/or Apartment. All occupants are presumed to have taken these regulations into account. The occupant agrees to 
                        keep the movable property made available to them in the Apartment in a good general condition and to report any defects or malfunction to reception. The Customer is also 
                        reminded that they must close all means of access to the apartment (partition openings, window(s) and front door) before leaving the property.
                        ADAGIO shall not be held responsible in the event of non-compliance with the above internal regulations.</p>
                    <p>ADAGIO reserves the right to enter the Apartments to perform housekeeping services, check the general condition, carry out technical maintenance and ensure that the 
                        safety conditions are upheld.</p>
                    <b class="M516">Pets:</b>
                    <p>In most cases (please check with the Aparthotel) and provided that the property are informed, only dogs and cats are allowed in Aparthotels; a rabies vaccination certificate 
                        and a certificate of ownership must be presented for dogs if the category that they belong to requires it. A daily fixed rates must be paid and will be collected on site. Service 
                        dogs and guide dogs for the blind are allowed free of charge. Category 1 and 2 dogs classified as dangerous are prohibited throughout our properties. Pets that are allowed 
                        shall not interfere with the safety and tranquillity of other persons on site. Their owners must respect the basic hygiene regulations and integrity of the facilities. Animals are 
                        not allowed to roam freely throughout the property and must be kept on a leash in common areas. They are not allowed near swimming pools or in breakfast rooms. In any 
                        event, pets shall remain under the full responsibility of their owner.
                    </p>
                    <b class="M516">WiFi:</b>
                    <p>ADAGIO Aparthotels offer free WiFi access so customers can connect to the Internet. The Customer also undertakes to ensure that the computer resources made available by 
                        ADAGIO are not used in any way to reproduce, represent, make available or communicate to the public works or objects protected by copyright or related intellectual 
                        property rights, such as text, images, photographs, musical works, audiovisual works, software and video games, without the authorisation of the right holders provided for in 
                        Books I and II of the Intellectual Property Code when such authorisation is required. The Customer is also required to comply with the security policy of the Internet access 
                        provider of the Aparthotel, including the rules governing the use of security measures put in place to prevent the illicit use of computer resources [or another term used in 
                        the company's IT charter] and to refrain from any act undermining the effectiveness of such measures. If the Customer does not comply with the aforementioned obligations, 
                        they may be accused of infringement within the meaning of Article L.335-3 of the Intellectual Property Code, punishable by a fine of 300,000 euros and three (3) years in 
                        prison.</p>
                    <p>If the Customer does not comply with any of the Internal Regulation provisions, or in the event of behaviour contrary to good morality and public order, ADAGIO may request 
                        the Customer to leave the property without any compensation and/or without any refund if payment has already been made. In the event where payment is still outstanding, 
                        or where a partial payment was made, the Customer must pay the cost of the services used before leaving the property. ADAGIO also reserves the right to lodge a complaint 
                        or report any incidents to the competent authorities.</p>

                <strong>14. Liability - Applicable regulations</strong>
                <div class="L316">
                    <p>The status of ADAGIO Aparthotels varies depending on the country. The status of the properties is indicated on ADAGIO’s website and on all communication material. 
                        Regulations relating to the country and status of the property shall apply. We therefore wish to reiterate that the renting of Tourist Residences is not covered by the liability 
                        regulations applicable to hotel operators. As a consequence, ADAGIO does not accept any liability in the event of loss, theft or damage to personal effects at its properties 
                        that are classified as Tourist Residences, either in the Apartments themselves or throughout car parks or common areas. The statute of limitations for amounts owed in 
                        connection with services sold by ADAGIO does not fall within the scope for applying the hotel industry's statute of limitations (Article 2272 of the Civil Code). As an exception 
                        to Article 2244 of the French Civil Code, a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by ADAGIO to a customer debtor shall interrupt the applicable statute of 
                        limitations. </p>
                    <p>The occupant may not invoke the legal provisions applicable to residential leases, including those related to security of tenure. The occupant agrees not to provide the 
                        property’s address as their residential address for tax or professional purposes, nor lend or sublet the Apartment to a third party, in any capacity. The GTCS are governed by 
                        French law, without prejudice to the governing law applicable under international private law. This applies to both substantive rules and procedural rules.</p>
                    <p>The photographs presented on the website and/or in the catalogue aren’t contractua. Although every effort is made to ensure that any photographs, graphic representations 
                        and texts reproduced for the purpose of illustrating the Aparthotels provide as accurate an impression as possible of the accommodation services offered, variations may 
                        occur, notably as a result of changes to furniture or any possible renovation work. The Customer is not entitled to make any claim on these grounds.</p>

                    Booking a stay with ADAGIO generally implies the acceptance of the GTCS. These terms and conditions apply for the duration that they are published online at <a href="https://www.adagio-city.com/" target="_blank">www.adagio-
                    city.com</a> and can be amended and/or added to at any time by ADAGIO. The new version of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale will automatically apply as soon as it is 
                    posted online. In the event of a discrepancy between the GTCS and the special terms and conditions of a particular rate (public rates that cannot be changed or are non-
                    refundable) or contract (Corporate, Leisure, Group contracts, etc.), the latter shall prevail. The completion of the booking by the Customer shall constitute their agreement 
                    regarding the GTCS and the Conditions of Sale applicable to the reserved rate at the time of booking. The Customer has the ability to save and print out these GTCS using the 
                    standard features of their browser or computer.
